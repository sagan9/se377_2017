# Introduction to Big Data Analysis and Visualization (SE377, 2017)

**_(This page will be frequently updated, especially during the first few weeks of the term.)_**

## Overview

Several topics and tools can be covered under the name of _'Big Data Analysis and Visualization'_. Amongst those, _data science_ will be the main focus of this course. In other words, you may understand this course as _'Data Science 101'_. More specifically, the following topics will be covered.

- Introduction of data science (what it is)
- Web-scraping and/or other data acquisition methods
- Data processing
- Statistical/machine learning technique (with focus on using them), e.g.,
  - Regression and statistical inference
  - Clustering and classification
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- (Optional) Flavor of data engineering

During the class, I will use python (with several packages; numpy/scipy, pandas, matplotlib) as a main tool or programming languages. You may choose your own tool

## Target audience

Junior or Senior who are interested in
- obtaining (hidden) insights from data
- working at any organization which make decision based on data (incl. startups)
- learning LOTS of things

The following courses are prerequisite.
- Programming
- Probability and Statistics

The following courses are recommended to be taken before/after taking this course if you are interested in data science.
- Databases
- Machine learning
- Algorithms
- (Optional) Computer Systems

## Course Schedule

## Course materials

### (Unofficial) textbooks

There is no official textbook(s) for this course. Although the following books (all of them are very well written!) cover most of topics of this course.

- Python for Data Analysis
- Doing Data Science
- Data Science from Scratch

### Reading list

Lecture notes and lab notes will be uploaded to this repository. Reading list (blog, tutorials, news articles, presentation slides) will be given almost every lecture.

### Environment

#### Analysis tools

- (Recommended) python: jupyter notebook, numpy/scipy, pandas, matplotlib, ...
  - It is recommended to use anaconda instead of installing python and packages. See [Installation](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)
- R: R studio, jupyter notebook, dplyr, ggplot, ...
- Other tools may be used, but not recommended.

#### elice

elice is a online IDE for several programming languages. elice will be mainly used for submitting your assignments. You are required to
- Register at [dgist.elice.io](https://dgist.elice.io/) with your dgist email
- Subscribe to this course at [Introduction to Big Data Analysis and Visualization](https://dgist.elice.io/courses/206/)

#### github

[github](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collation. It is REQUIRED to submit your final report, your analysis and EDA processes, and all the datasets throught github. github will be covered

You can refer tutorials on git and github.
- [git - simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.html)
- [github - Hello, world](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Students may get free pravite gihub access and other development tools. Request your account through [GitHub Education - Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## Grading

### Breakdown _(Subject to change)_

| Area                | Weight |
|---------------------|--------|
| Assignments         |   35%  |
| Proposal            |   15%  |
| Final Presentation  |   10%  |
| Final Report        |   25%  |
| Assessements*       |   15%  |

`*` Assessments of analysis of other teams

In addition, $2^{max(n - 3, 0)}$ points will be deducted from the final weighted score, where $n$ is the number of absences. (Note: the probability of attendance check has positive correlation with absence ratio of the class, i.e., ratio of the number of (roughly estimated absent student) to the total class size)

### Letter grades _(Subject to change)_

| Score | Grade |
|-------|-------|
| >= 85 |   A   |
| >= 70 |   B   |
| >= 50 |   C   |
|  < 50 |   D   |
| if needed | F |

## Chatting and Plagiarism

Each student is required to finish all the assignments by his/her own, and each project team should finish their term project on their own.

Although students are allowed and encouraged to discuss general topics, the following behaviors are STRICTLY forbidden.
- Discussing specific approaches for assignments
- Sharing codes for assignments
- Submitting someone else's analysis as a proposal

## Other policies

You may bring and use your notebook or tablet during the class. But the use of digital devices should be limited to course materials (e.g., lecture notes, code execution).
